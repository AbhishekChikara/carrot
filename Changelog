0.4.0-pre3 :date:`2009-05-29 02:27 P.M CET` :author:askh@opera.com
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Publisher.send: Now supports message priorities (a number between ``0``
		and ``9``).

	* Publihser.send: Added ``routing_key`` keyword argument. Can override
		the routing key for a single message.

	* Publisher.send: Support for the ``immediate`` and ``mandatory`` flags.

0.4.0-pre2 :date:`2009-05-29 02:27 P.M CET` :author:askh@opera.com
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* AMQPConnection: Added ``connect_timeout`` timeout option, which is
		the timeout in seconds before we exhaust trying to establish a
		connection to the AMQP server.

0.4.0-pre1 :date:`2009-05-27 04:27 P.M CET` :author:askh@opera.com
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* This version introduces backends. The consumers and publishers
		all have an associated backend. Currently there are two backends
		available; ``pyamqlib`` and ``pyqueue``. The ``amqplib`` backend
		is for production use, while the ``Queue`` backend is for use while
		unit testing.

	* Consumer/Publisher operations no longer re-establishes the connection
	  if the connection has been closed.

	* ``Consumer.next`` has been deprecated for a while, and has now been
	  removed.

	* Message objects now have a ``decode`` method, to deserialize the
	  message body.

	* You can now use the Consumer class standalone, without subclassing,
	  by registering callbacks by using ``Consumer.register_callback``.

	* Ability to filter messages in ``Consumer.discard_all``.

	* carrot now includes a basic unit test suite, which hopefully will
		be more complete in later releases.

	* carrot now uses the Sphinx documentation system.

0.3.9 :date:`2009-05-18 04:49 P.M CET` :author:askh@opera.com
--------------------------------------------------------------

	* Consumer.wait() now works properly again. Thanks Alexander Solovyov!

0.3.8 :date:`2009-05-11 02:14 P.M CET` :author:askh@opera.com
--------------------------------------------------------------

	* Rearranged json module import order.
	New order is cjson > simplejson > json > django.util.somplejson

	* _Backwards incompatible change_:
	Have to instantiate AMQPConnection object before passing
	it to consumers/publishers. e.g before when you did

		>>> consumer = Consumer(connection=DjangoAMQPConnection)

	you now have to do

		>>> consumer = Consumer(connection=DjangoAMQPConnection())

	or sometimes you might even want to share the same connection with
	publisher/consumer.
